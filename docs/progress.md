# Progress log

Running record of what has been built, what is blocked, and what is next.
**Update this at the end of any session that changes state.**

`plan.md` §14 holds the formal tracker; this file holds the narrative and the
operational detail — resource IDs, gotchas, and the reasoning behind partial
states. Newest entries first.

## State at a glance

| | |
|---|---|
| **Branch** | `feat/day3-auth-identity` |
| **`main`** | green on all five CI jobs |
| **Tests** | 236 passing (local + CI) |
| **Coverage** | 70% |
| **Days done** | 1, 2 complete · 3, 4, 5, 6 partial |
| **Next** | Day 7 — versions, review, confirm gate, status polling |

### Deferred by decision — revisit before launch

| Item | Decided | Why deferred | What it takes to land |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Legacy `.doc` (OLE2) parsing** | 2026-09-11 | No maintained pure-Python reader; the alternatives are native binaries that would go in the Docker image. | Either drop `application/msword` from the accepted types, or add a converter. Currently accepted at upload and will fail at parse — **decide before launch**. |

> ⚠️ **Switching parser is not a drop-in.** Invariant 1 requires a score to be
> reproducible from the stored extraction chain. A different parser yields
> different text, so it yields a different score. `parser` and `parser_version`
> are stored per extraction precisely so a replay can tell which engine produced
> a score, and so a change is a **re-score**, not a silent drift.

**Full register: [`blockers.md`](blockers.md)** — 40 items by category.

### Blocked, and not on us

| Blocker | Blocks | Lead time |
|
| **Textract account activation** | OCR fallback for scanned CVs | `SubscriptionRequiredException` on a brand-new AWS account, with `AdministratorAccess` — so it is account activation, not IAM. Usually clears within hours. **Code is written and wired; run `backend/scripts/verify_ocr_fallback.py` once it clears.** |

---|---|---|
| ~~TRAI DLT registration~~ | — | ✅ **Started 2026-09-11.** Still 2–4 weeks to clear; SMS to Indian numbers fails until it does. |
| **Twilio account** | Phone OTP, the 3 Cognito custom-auth Lambdas | Days |
| **Google OAuth client** | Google federation on the candidate pool | Hours |
| **N7 — who makes the course?** | **Launch, not the build** | Build unblocked 2026-09-11 with a placeholder course and a provisional, versioned completion rule. The product question is untouched: a completion still moves a real score by up to 30 points on criteria nobody has agreed. See `blockers.md` C1. |
| **N2 — can CV text leave India?** | Day 8 scoring design | Open. `ap-south-1` chosen so the answer cannot be wrong. |

## 2026-09-11 (later) — Day 5, Week 1 gate

### Built

- `tests/unit/test_permission_matrix.py` — role x guard matrix over all **10**
  roles (SRS 1.2; note the plan's prose says nine). Calls the dependency
  callables directly with a constructed `TenantContext`, so 10x10 coverage costs
  no database round trips. Also asserts `require_role` rejects an unknown role at
  *import* time, so a typo fails the build rather than silently admitting nobody.
- `tests/invariants/test_route_authorisation.py` — drives every documented route
  with no `Authorization` header and asserts 401/403 unless explicitly
  allowlisted, with the reason recorded beside each exemption.

121 -> 160 tests.

### Two judgement calls worth knowing

**The route guard asks the app, it does not read its dependency tree.** The
structural version needs FastAPI internals (`_IncludedRouter`,
`_EffectiveRouteContext`) that changed in this version and will change again —
and it only proves a guard is *declared*. Driving the route proves the request is
actually refused. Verified by adding a deliberately unguarded route and
confirming the test names it.

**Known limit, stated rather than hidden:** routes with
`include_in_schema=False` are invisible to it. Today that is only `/`, asserted
separately.

### Day 5 is partial, not done

The gate has four parts. Permission matrix, no-anonymous-access and the
audit/revocation tests are green. **Cross-tenant is proven at the database layer
only** (`test_rls_and_grants.py`), because the plan's "every tenant-scoped
endpoint" cannot be tested against five endpoints — the rest are Week 2. The
harness is in place; the HTTP-layer suite lands with the endpoints.

## 2026-09-11 — Day 3/4 auth chain, and AWS

### Built

The identity spine (`PR #2`, `#3`, `#4`):

- `app/core/auth/` — pluggable `IdentityProvider`. `cognito.py` verifies RS256
  against pool JWKS **with the algorithm pinned**; `local.py` is a dev-only
  provider behind `AUTH_ALLOW_LOCAL_TOKENS`.
- `membership.py` — role and tenant from our `memberships` table, cached 60s in
  Redis. Never from token claims.
- `core/cache.py`, `core/ratelimit.py` — Redis lifecycle, fixed-window limiter.
- identity module router/service/repository/schemas; `test_auth_chain.py` (18 tests).

### AWS — applied and verified

Account `592033927084`, `ap-south-1`. 38 resources via `infra/terraform`.

| Resource | ID |
|---|---|
| Cognito candidate pool | `ap-south-1_afBHHXfyH` |
| Cognito business pool | `ap-south-1_w1u6W6fTP` (MFA required, admin-create only) |
| S3 | 6 buckets, `bharatpath-<name>-dev-592033927084`, private + AES256 + versioned |
| SQS | `bharatpath-tasks-dev` + DLQ |
| IAM | `bharatpath-app-dev`, least-privilege |

Verified rather than assumed: the **production** `cognito.py` path fetched live
JWKS from both pools and correctly rejected an `alg=none` forgery. App IAM
credentials were tested in both directions — S3/SQS succeed, bucket creation and
IAM listing are denied.

Deliberately **not** provisioned: RDS, ElastiCache, VPC/NAT, ECS. Those bill at
idle and are Day 20 concerns. Postgres and Redis stay in docker/CI.

### Four bugs CI caught that local checks had hidden

Worth reading before trusting a green local run:

1. **`pool: str` + hand-rolled validator** when `Pool` Literal existed, forcing a
   **malformed** `type: ignore`. mypy had never been run.
2. **`Routers never touch repositories`** forbade `router → service → repository`
   — the exact layering it exists to enforce. It could only pass on a module whose
   service does no persistence. Fixed with `allow_indirect_imports`, then verified
   it *still* breaks on a direct import.
3. **CI died in the migrations step**: the new `Settings` validator demands an auth
   mechanism, and CI set none. Invisible locally because `backend/.env` sets it and
   CI has no `.env`.
4. **`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tests'`** — CI runs `pytest`; running
   `python -m pytest` puts cwd on `sys.path` and hid it. Fixed by making `tests` a
   real package.

**Lesson worth keeping: run the CI command, not your habitual one.**
