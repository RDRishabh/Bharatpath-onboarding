# 04 — Resume & Score APIs: input/output reference

This is the core loop of the whole product: a candidate gets a CV into the
system, reviews what was read from it, confirms it, and — only then — a score
appears. Read [01-architecture.md](01-architecture.md) first for the general
module shape; this doc covers `resume` (9 endpoints) and `scoring`
(1 endpoint).

---

## 0. The big picture — three ways in, one gate, one trigger

There are **three different ways** a CV's content can get into the system:

| Way | Endpoint | When used |
|---|---|---|
| Upload a file | `POST /candidate/resume/uploads` → `.../complete` | Candidate has a PDF/DOCX |
| Paste text | `POST /candidate/resume/text` | Candidate has no file, just text |
| Fill a form | `POST /candidate/resume/manual` | Candidate has neither |

**All three roads lead to the same place: an unconfirmed "resume version."**
None of them produce a score by themselves. Every version — however it was
created — must pass through the same **review → confirm** step before
scoring will ever touch it. That's the single most important rule in this
whole module, so the full sequence for the *upload* path (the longest one)
looks like this:

```
1. POST /candidate/resume/uploads
      → backend hands back a presigned S3 URL. Nothing saved in the DB yet.
2. App uploads the raw file bytes DIRECTLY to S3 using that URL
      → our backend is not even involved in this step.
3. POST /candidate/resume/uploads/{upload_id}/complete
      → NOW a `resume_files` row is created. Backend re-checks the file
        itself (size, type) from S3 — never trusts what the client claims.
        Kicks off a virus scan and queues parsing. Returns 202 (queued).
4. App polls: GET /candidate/resume/files/{resume_file_id}
      → until parse_status is DONE (or FAILED/BLOCKED)
5. Parsing finishes → a `resume_version` row now exists, UNCONFIRMED.
6. GET /candidate/resume/versions/{resume_version_id}
      → "the review screen." Shows exactly what was extracted.
7. Candidate looks at it. Two branches:
      a) Looks right  → POST /candidate/resume/versions/{id}/confirm
      b) Something's wrong → POST /candidate/resume/versions/{id}/edit
                              → creates a NEW unconfirmed version, back to step 6
8. Confirm succeeds → an event fires → a background worker scores it
9. GET /candidate/score/me
      → PENDING at first, then READY once the worker finishes
```

**Paste-text and manual-form skip steps 1–5** (no file, no scan, no async
parsing — the version is created directly, already sitting at step 6/7),
but they still go through review → confirm exactly the same way. There is
**no path, of any kind, that reaches a score without passing through
confirm.**

### Why review-then-confirm exists at all

Resume parsing is not perfectly accurate — a two-column layout, a scanned
photo, a borderless table can all produce text that reads as plausible but
is wrong, in a way only the candidate themself can catch. Attaching a score
to that without the candidate having seen it first would mean scoring
garbage silently. So the system makes it structurally impossible to skip:
`resume.service.get_scorable_version` — the only function scoring is allowed
to read through — filters with `WHERE confirmed_at IS NOT NULL` at the SQL
level. An unconfirmed version isn't "hidden," it's **never loaded** by
anything that scores.

### Why confirming triggers scoring through an *event*, not a direct call

`confirm_version()` doesn't call the scoring code. It emits an event,
`resume.version_confirmed`, onto an outbox, and a routing table
(`app/tasks/routing.py`) says what happens next:

```python
EVENT_SUBSCRIPTIONS = {
    "resume.version_confirmed": (SCORE_RESUME_TASK,),   # ← only this event
    ...
}
```

The obvious-looking alternative — trigger scoring when a version is
*created* — is explicitly wrong and explicitly tested against
(`tests/invariants/test_confirm_gate.py`): a version is created on **every**
parse and **every** correction, confirmed or not, so wiring scoring to
creation would score content the candidate never approved, while every other
test in the app kept passing. The confirm gate would still exist in the code
— it just would never be called. Subscribing to the *confirmed* event
specifically is what makes the gate actually load-bearing.

## 1. `POST /candidate/resume/uploads` — start a file upload

Requires: `CANDIDATE` role.

**No request body.**

**Response** — `201 Created` (`UploadTicketResponse`):
```json
{
  "upload_id": "9f2e...",
  "url": "https://s3.../presigned-put-url...",
  "method": "PUT",
  "expires_in_seconds": 900,
  "max_bytes": 10485760,
  "accepted_types": ["application/pdf", "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document"]
}
```

**Nothing is written to the database at this point** — deliberately. If the
upload never happens or fails partway, there's no half-finished row to clean
up; the object just expires from S3 on its own.

**What the app does next:** `PUT` the raw file bytes straight to `url`, not
to our backend. There's also no `key` field in this response — the object's
S3 path is derived server-side from the caller's own id, so a client can
never write into another candidate's storage prefix even if it tried.

---

## 2. `POST /candidate/resume/uploads/{upload_id}/complete`

Requires: `CANDIDATE` role.

**No request body** — just the `upload_id` from step 1, in the path.

**Response** — `202 Accepted` (`UploadCompleteResponse`):
```json
{ "resume_file_id": "9f2e...", "scan_status": "PENDING", "parse_status": "QUEUED" }
```

**What happens on the backend, in order:**
1. Re-derives the expected S3 key from *the authenticated user*, not from
   anything the client sent.
2. Reads the actual file size from S3 (never trusts a client-reported size).
3. Reads the first few bytes and **sniffs the real file type** from content,
   not from the filename or a claimed `Content-Type`.
4. If it fails any check → the object is deleted from S3 immediately (no
   reason to keep personal data we're about to reject) and this returns an
   error, never a row.
5. If it passes → kicks off a virus scan, creates the `resume_files` row,
   and queues parsing as a background job.

**202, not 200 or 201:** parsing hasn't happened yet — this only confirms
the file was accepted for processing.

**Idempotent:** calling this twice for the same `upload_id` doesn't create a
second row or re-queue anything — it just returns that row's current state.

---

## 3. `GET /candidate/resume/files/{resume_file_id}` — poll for parse result

Requires: `CANDIDATE` role. The app calls this repeatedly after step 2 until
parsing settles.

**Response** — `200 OK` (`ResumeFileStatusResponse`):
```json
{
  "resume_file_id": "9f2e...",
  "scan_status": "CLEAN",
  "parse_status": "DONE",
  "parse_error_code": null,
  "terminal": true,
  "uploaded_at": "2026-09-17T10:00:00Z",
  "resume_version_id": "3a1c..."
}
```
| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `scan_status` | Virus scan result — separate from parsing because they fail differently and the candidate can only act on one of them. |
| `parse_status` | `QUEUED` → `DONE` / `FAILED` / `BLOCKED`. |
| `terminal` | **Stop polling when this is `true`** — not when `resume_version_id` appears. A `FAILED` parse never produces a version, so polling for a version on a failed parse waits forever. |
| `resume_version_id` | Only present once parsing succeeded — this is what you fetch next. |

404, never 403, for a file belonging to someone else — existence of another
candidate's row is never confirmed.

---

## 4. `POST /candidate/resume/text` — paste-text path

Requires: `CANDIDATE` role. No file, no scan, no async wait.

**Request body** (`PasteTextRequest`):
```json
{ "text": "John Doe\nSoftware Engineer at Acme...\n(at least 50 characters)" }
```
`text` must be ≥50 characters *after* whitespace normalisation — and that
normalisation happens **once, here, at write time, forever**. Why it can
never be re-normalised later: a score must be reproducible from exactly what
was stored (invariant 1) — if the normalisation rule changed later and was
re-applied, the same stored row could yield a different score on replay.

**Response** — `201 Created` (`ResumeVersionResponse`):
```json
{ "resume_version_id": "3a1c...", "source": "PASTE", "confirmed": false, "created_at": "..." }
```
Straight to `201`, not `202` — there's nothing asynchronous to wait for. This
version is already reviewable (skip to step 6 below).

---

## 5. `POST /candidate/resume/manual` — structured form path

Requires: `CANDIDATE` role. For a candidate with no document at all.

**Request body** (`ManualResumeRequest`):
```json
{
  "full_name": "John Doe",
  "headline": "Backend Engineer",
  "experience": [
    { "employer": "Acme Corp", "title": "SDE-2", "start_year": 2021, "end_year": null, "summary": "..." }
  ],
  "education": [
    { "institution": "XYZ University", "qualification": "B.Tech CSE", "completed_year": 2020 }
  ],
  "skills": ["Python", "PostgreSQL"]
}
```
**Notice what's absent: no date of birth, no age, anywhere.** That's not an
oversight — invariant 5 forbids age-gating entirely, and
`scripts/check_no_age_fields.py` fails the CI build if a field like that is
ever added. `end_year` must not be before `start_year` (validated).

**Response:** same `ResumeVersionResponse` shape as the paste-text path,
`source: "MANUAL"`.

---

## 6. `GET /candidate/resume/versions` — the version list

Requires: `CANDIDATE` role. Lists every version this candidate has ever
created, **newest first, no content** — just enough for a history screen
(dates, confirmed/not, which one replaced which).

**Response** — `200 OK`, array of `ResumeVersionSummary`:
```json
[
  {
    "resume_version_id": "3a1c...", "source": "EDIT", "confirmed": true,
    "confirmed_at": "2026-09-17T11:00:00Z", "supersedes_id": "9f2e...",
    "superseded": false, "created_at": "2026-09-17T10:55:00Z"
  }
]
```
`superseded: true` means a *newer* version has replaced this one — a
superseded version can no longer be edited or confirmed (it's frozen
history at that point).

---

## 7. `GET /candidate/resume/versions/{resume_version_id}` — the review screen

Requires: `CANDIDATE` role. **This is the only endpoint in the entire module
that returns the full extracted content.** Everything else deliberately
withholds it (see §6's list, which shows only metadata).

**Response** — `200 OK` (`ResumeVersionDetailResponse`):
```json
{
  "resume_version_id": "3a1c...",
  "source": "UPLOAD",
  "parsed": {
    "full_name": "John Doe",
    "experience": [ ... ],
    "education": [ ... ],
    "skills": [ ... ],
    "extractor": { "parser": "pypdf", "parser_version": "4.2.0" }
  },
  "confirmed": false,
  "confirmed_at": null,
  "supersedes_id": null,
  "superseded": false,
  "created_at": "..."
}
```
`parsed` includes an `extractor` provenance block — *which* parser produced
this text and what version. That's not bookkeeping: a different parser
produces different text and therefore a legitimately different score, so a
future dispute or re-score needs to know exactly which engine read this CV.

**This is the exact content that gets scored if confirmed** — so this
response is what makes confirming an informed decision, not a blind button
press.

---

## 8. `POST /candidate/resume/versions/{resume_version_id}/edit` — correct it

Requires: `CANDIDATE` role.

**Request body** (`ResumeEditRequest`) — send **exactly one** of:
```json
{ "text": "the corrected CV, as plain text, at least 50 characters..." }
```
or
```json
{ "structured": { "full_name": "...", "experience": [...], "education": [...], "skills": [...] } }
```
Sending both, or neither, is a `422` — there's no rule for how to merge two
different shapes of "the truth," so the API refuses to guess.

**Response** — `201 Created`, a new `ResumeVersionResponse`, `source: "EDIT"`.

**What actually happens:** this **never modifies** the version you're
correcting — it creates a **brand-new** version, chained to the old one
(`supersedes_id`), and the new one starts **unconfirmed again**, even if the
one it replaced was already confirmed. A correction always has to go back
through review (§7) and be confirmed again — nothing is exempt from the
gate just because a similar version once passed it. `409` if the version
you're trying to edit has already been superseded by something newer (you
can only edit the current tip of the chain).

---

## 9. `POST /candidate/resume/versions/{resume_version_id}/confirm` — the gate

Requires: `CANDIDATE` role. **This is SRS 1.4.4, the mandatory confirm gate.**

**No request body** — just the version id in the path.

**Response** — `200 OK` (`ResumeConfirmResponse`):
```json
{ "resume_version_id": "3a1c...", "confirmed_at": "2026-09-17T11:00:00Z", "already_confirmed": false }
```

**Order of checks inside this call matters:**
1. Does this version exist, and belong to this candidate? (else `404`)
2. Has it already been superseded by a newer edit? (else `409` — confirming
   stale content that the candidate has since corrected would score the
   wrong thing)
3. Is it already confirmed? If so, this is treated as a harmless retry —
   returns `200` with `already_confirmed: true` and the **original**
   `confirmed_at` timestamp, never a new one. When a candidate approved
   their content is a fact about them, not about how many times their phone
   lost signal mid-request.
4. Otherwise: the confirmation is written (a one-way latch — `confirmed_at`
   can only move from `NULL` to a value, never back), and **only now** the
   `resume.version_confirmed` event fires.

That event is what a background worker picks up to actually run scoring —
see §0 above for why it's this specific event and not "version created."

---

## 10. `GET /candidate/score/me` — the candidate's own score

Requires: `CANDIDATE` role **and an active subscription** (pay-first, R13 —
a lapsed subscriber gets `402`, but their score history is never deleted).

**No request body.**

**Response while scoring hasn't finished yet** — `200 OK` (not `404` — a
confirmed resume waiting on a background job is a normal state, not a
missing resource):
```json
{ "status": "PENDING", "value": null, "band": null, "computed_at": null }
```

**Response once scored** — `200 OK`:
```json
{ "status": "READY", "value": 812, "band": "SOLID", "computed_at": "2026-09-17T11:05:00Z" }
```
| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `value` | 700–990. Floored at display time (`display_value`) — what's stored is what was computed, the floor is applied only at this response boundary. |
| `band` | One of `ENTRY` / `DEVELOPING` / `SOLID` / `STRONG`. |

**What this response will *never* contain, on purpose, and it's tested
against (`test_score_never_explained.py`):** any breakdown, any category
score, any "what to improve," the model's raw output, or the
`resume_version_id` that produced it. The client confirmed twice (2026-08-27
and 2026-09-11) that the score is shown as a single number and nothing else
— no explanation screen exists anywhere in this product, by design, not by
omission.

**What actually computes the number** — Layer 1 (an AI model reads the CV
into structured facts) then Layers 2–3 (ordinary versioned code turns facts
into a 700–990 number) — is its own topic; this doc stops at "an event
triggers it and here's what comes back." A dedicated scoring-internals doc
can go deeper if useful later.
