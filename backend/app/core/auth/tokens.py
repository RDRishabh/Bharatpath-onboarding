"""What a verified token is, and what any verifier must promise.

The shape of this module is the point. Authentication has exactly one
production implementation (Cognito) and exactly one local substitute, and they
sit behind the same protocol so that **the code under test is the code that
ships**. The alternative -- a stub `current_user` that returns a fixed
identity in development -- silently disables every gate downstream of it, which
is how a permission matrix ends up green against a service that checks nothing.

`VerifiedToken` deliberately carries no role and no tenant. Those are read from
our `memberships` table on every request (see `app.core.auth.membership`), not
from a claim, because a claim goes stale and a revocation that does not take
effect is the tenant-isolation failure SRS 2.24.7 forbids.
