"""The production identity provider: RS256 verification against Cognito JWKS.

This is real code on the real path. It is not exercised locally only because
Cognito cannot be emulated -- LocalStack's free tier does not provide it, and
the candidate pool additionally needs three custom-auth Lambda triggers that
are infrastructure rather than application code (docs/plan.md section 5.7).
The moment the pools exist, this class is what runs, unchanged.

**Cognito is not consulted for authorisation.** It answers "who is this", and
nothing else. Role and tenant come from `memberships`.
