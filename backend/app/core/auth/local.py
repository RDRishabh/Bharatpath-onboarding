"""A local stand-in for Cognito, for development and tests only.

**Why this exists.** Cognito cannot be run locally: LocalStack's free tier does
not provide it, and the candidate pool additionally needs three custom-auth
Lambda triggers that are infrastructure. Without something here, every day of
work that sits behind authentication -- resume upload, scoring, discovery,
every gate -- would have to be written blind and tested for the first time in
a deployed environment.

**What it is not.** It is not a stub. A stubbed `current_user` that returns a
fixed identity silently disables every check downstream of it, and a
permission matrix that passes against such a stub proves nothing. This issues
and verifies genuine RS256 JWTs, with the same claim validation, the same
failure modes, and the same code path as `CognitoIdentityProvider`. Only the
issuer differs.

**How it is kept out of production**, three ways, deliberately overlapping:

  1. `Settings._local_auth_is_never_production` refuses to construct settings
     with `auth_allow_local_tokens` set in staging or prod. The process does
     not boot.
  2. The signing key is generated in memory at start-up and never persisted.
     Every restart invalidates every token, and no key exists to leak.
  3. `POST /auth/dev/token`, the only way to obtain one, is registered on the
     router only while the flag is on, so it is absent from `openapi.json` in
     any other environment.
