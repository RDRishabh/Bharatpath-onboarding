"""resume - SQLAlchemy ORM models.

Upload, parse jobs, versions, review and confirm.

**Versions are immutable and append-only.** An edit creates a new
`resume_versions` row pointing at the one it supersedes; it never mutates the
old one. That is what lets `scores.resume_version_id` mean something six
months later, which is half of invariant 1.

**The confirm gate is mandatory** (SRS 1.4.4). An unconfirmed version can never
reach scoring, because parsing is not 100% accurate and the candidate has to
see and correct what was extracted before a number is attached to it.
