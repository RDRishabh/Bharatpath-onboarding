# BharatPath development infrastructure.
#
# Scope is deliberately narrow. This provisions only what cannot be run
# locally -- Cognito above all, which has no emulator (LocalStack's free
# tier does not provide it, and app/core/auth/cognito.py is written
# against the real thing).
#
# Postgres and Redis are NOT here. They run in docker-compose for local
# work and as service containers in CI, which is free and faster than a
# round trip to Mumbai. RDS, ElastiCache, VPC/NAT and ECS arrive at
# deployment (plan.md Day 20), not during the sprint -- those are the
# resources that bill while idle.
#
# Everything below is either free-tier or fractions of a rupee at dev
# volume, so there is nothing to shut down between sessions.
# `terraform destroy` removes all of it if needed.
