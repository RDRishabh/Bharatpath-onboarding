    A single mailbox to send from while the client has no domain (blockers

    confirmation link to this address, and once somebody clicks it the
    account may send `From:` that address and nothing else.

    This is the stop-gap, not the destination. Set `email_domain` instead as
    soon as the domain and its DNS exist -- an address identity cannot carry
    DKIM alignment, so mail sent this way is markedly more likely to be
    filtered as spam, and every message is From: a personal-looking mailbox.

    Ignored when `email_domain` is set: a domain identity covers every
    address at that domain, so both would be redundant.

    Create the EC2 test host. **Default false, and that matters:** everything

    so switching it on is a deliberate act.

      terraform apply -var deploy_ec2=true
      terraform apply -var deploy_ec2=false   # tears the host down again

    x86_64 rather than Graviton on purpose -- `backend/Dockerfile` is built
    wherever it is run, and an image built on an x86 machine will not start
    on ARM. Move to t4g when images are built in CI for a pinned arch.

    2 GiB is enough and not generous: Postgres and Redis take their share.
