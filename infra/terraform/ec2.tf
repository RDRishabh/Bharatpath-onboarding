# The test deployment: one EC2 host running the whole stack in docker compose.
#
# Added 2026-09-22. **This is deliberately not production**, and the shape of
# it is a decision rather than a shortcut -- see `docs/aws-deployment.md` for
# the migration to ECS Fargate + ALB + RDS + ElastiCache, which is where this
# goes and which is why several things below are arranged the way they are.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# What this is, and what it is not
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# One instance, in the DEFAULT VPC, with a public IP. API, Celery worker,
# Celery beat, Postgres and Redis all run as containers on it, exactly as
# they do on a developer's laptop. There is no private subnet, no NAT
# gateway, no load balancer and no managed database.
#
# The cost of that choice is honest and worth writing down:
#
#   * **Postgres has no managed backups.** It is a container on an EBS
#     volume. The volume survives an instance replacement (it is separate,
#     below) and nothing else protects it. Do not put data here you would
#     mind losing.
#   * **The database is reachable from the instance only**, which is the one
#     thing this does keep right: 5432 and 6379 are not in the security group.
#   * **No horizontal scale and no zero-downtime deploy.** `docker compose up`
#     restarts the API.
#   * **TLS terminates on the box** (Caddy, see user_data) rather than at an
#     ALB with ACM.
#
# What it does give the app teams is a real, reachable, authenticated API with
# real Cognito, real S3 and real SQS behind it -- which is what unblocks them.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Everything here is behind `var.deploy_ec2`
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Default false. The rest of this module is free at idle; an instance is not,
# and the sprint's working assumption -- that nothing bills between sessions --
# stops being true the moment this is switched on. Turning it on must be a
# deliberate act, and turning it off again is `-var deploy_ec2=false`.

# choice once images are built in CI for a pinned architecture.

# Identity: an instance role, NOT the IAM user's access key

# boto3 finds it through the instance metadata service with no configuration,
# so `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` are simply absent from
# the host's environment file.
#
# That is the point. A long-lived secret key in an env file on a public box is
# the credential most likely to leak and the hardest to notice leaking;
# instance-role credentials are rotated by AWS and never written down. The IAM
# user stays for local development, where there is no instance to assume a
# role.

# with a different principal, so this is one of the pieces that does not have
