# Email: every message the product sends, and every code Cognito sends.
#
# Added 2026-09-18, when the client dropped SMS and phone OTP until the
# organisation's registration (and with it TRAI DLT) exists. From then on:
#
#   * Cognito sends sign-up verification codes, password-reset codes and the
#     temporary password of an account staff created -- through SES, not
#     Cognito's built-in sender, which is capped at about 50 emails a day and
#     sends from a no-reply@verificationemail.com address nobody trusts.
#   * The backend sends notifications (`NOTIFICATIONS_EMAIL_PROVIDER=ses`).
#
# **Two ways to be able to send** (the second added 2026-09-22):
#
#   `email_domain`         -- the destination. Verified by DNS, carries DKIM.
#   `email_sender_address` -- one mailbox, while the client has no domain
#                             (blockers E38). Verified by a link SES emails to
#                             it. No DKIM, so worse deliverability.
#
# Set neither and nothing here is created; the backend records every email as
# SKIPPED `PROVIDER_UNCONFIGURED` and Cognito falls back to its own sender
# (about 50/day, from an address nobody trusts).
#
# **Either way, SES production access is a separate support request**, and
# until it is granted the account is in the sandbox and can send only *to*
# addresses that are themselves verified. See infra/README.md, "Email", and
# `docs/aws-deployment.md`.

# **Applying this does not make email work.** SES sends a confirmation link to
# the address and the identity stays unverified until somebody opens that
# mailbox and clicks it. Terraform reports success either way, because
# creating the identity is all it can do.
#
# The second, larger catch is the SES **sandbox**, which is where every new
# account starts and which is not visible in this file at all: in the sandbox
# you may send only *to* addresses that are themselves verified. So a verified
# sender plus the sandbox means email works between your own verified
# addresses and reaches no real candidate. Production access is a support
# request -- see infra/README.md, and `docs/aws-deployment.md`.
